# Optimization Assignment: Flight Scheduling & Marketing Budget

This project was completed as part of a university simulation course and involves two separate optimization problems, each solved using both GAMS and IBM CPLEX (OPL):

## 🛫 Problem 1: Flight Scheduling
A central airline hub must dispatch aircraft of three types (small, medium, large) to four destinations (A, B, C, D). The objectives are:
- Minimize operating cost
- Maximize profit
- Minimize total flight hours

Constraints include:
- Minimum number of daily flights to each city
- Flight hour limits per aircraft
- No medium aircraft flights to City D

## 📺 Problem 2: Marketing Budget Allocation
Given a fixed advertising budget, the task is to maximize customer reach through newspaper and TV ads, modeled with:
- Integer programming with binary variables for time intervals
- Two cases: unrestricted and restricted TV ad scenarios

## 📦 Files 
- GAMS and CPLEX code for each sub-problem
- Final reports in English(summary) and Persian
- README

## 📝 Notes
- All analysis and discussions are included in the final report.
- Unfortunately, the in-depth analysis is only available in Persian.
