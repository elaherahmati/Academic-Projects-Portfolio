# 🎓 Academic Projects Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of academic projects completed during my undergraduate and graduate studies in Industrial Engineering and Data Science. These projects span topics such as optimization, simulation, data analysis, and algorithmic development, and were implemented using tools like **Python**, **LINGO**, **GAMS**, **CPLEX**, and **C/C++**.

Each project is placed in its own subdirectory with a `README.md` and, where applicable, source code, report, and input/output files.
