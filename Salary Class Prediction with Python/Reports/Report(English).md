# ðŸ“˜ Salary Class Prediction Using HR Data

## Overview
This project explores supervised learning approaches to predict employee salary classes using HR data. It was developed as part of a university-level data mining course.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build predictive models that accurately classify employees into different salary groups based on key HR features such as satisfaction level, working hours, and job role.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset includes various employee features including:
- Satisfaction level
- Last evaluation
- Number of projects
- Average monthly hours
- Time spent at the company
- Work accident and promotion history
- Department and salary class

## ðŸ§ª Project Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Removed outliers and duplicates
- Balanced the dataset using SMOTE
- Reduced dimensions with PCA

### 2. Exploratory Analysis
- Assessed feature relationships using correlation and visual analysis
- Investigated impact of each feature on salary class

### 3. Modeling
Applied classification models:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

Evaluated performance using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion matrices
- Cross-validation

### 4. Results
- KNN and Random Forest showed the highest accuracy (~74%)
- Models were assessed for interpretability and practical usage

## âœ… Conclusion
The project demonstrated that ensemble models and distance-based classifiers perform well in predicting salary categories. Dimensionality reduction and balancing techniques improved model performance.
